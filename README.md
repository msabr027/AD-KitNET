# What is it ?

Adapted from the research below, it's a lighweight, unsupervised and agnostic system for detecting any kind of anomaly on any type of data.
The tool is based on three algorithms groups:Feature mapping, Ensembles of Autoencoder, Voting Layer(output layer).
In addition the tool can be used on data stream, images, marketing databases, fraud data.

The main advantage is the fact that no label is needed on data. You present the raw data to the system, and it take care of everything.
